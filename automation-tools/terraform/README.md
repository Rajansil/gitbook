# Terraform

**Terraform** is an open-source which is mostly used to manage a **data center infrastructure**. Terraform is important to its users because of the value it provides: one way Terraform offers value to its users is in its modules. Terraform modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together in a configuration. These modules provide an easy way to package and reuse common code.
