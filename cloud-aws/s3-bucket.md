Simply, **S3(Simple Storage Service)** is a AWS tool which allows us to store our file, folder, photo, movie and so on  in locally and publicly. It helps us to protect any amount of data for a long period of time. We can access the date that are in s3 from any where in any time. &#x20;

I named **rajan04**, region **N.California**, with **no public** access.
